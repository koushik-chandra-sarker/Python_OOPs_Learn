"""
Object Oriented Programming is a way of computer programming using the idea of “objects”
to represents data and methods. It is also, an approach used for creating neat and
reusable code instead of a redundant one.

Major principles of object-oriented programming system are given below.

    -> Class
    -> Object
    -> Method
    -> Inheritance
    -> Polymorphism
    -> Data Abstraction
    -> Encapsulation

Class:
    The class can be defined as a collection of objects. It is a logical entity that has some
    specific attributes and methods.

    A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

    Syntax:
        class ClassName:
            #statement_suite  

Object:
    Objects are an instance of a class. It is an entity that has state and behavior. In a nutshell,
    it is an instance of a class that can access the data.

    An object (instance) is an instantiation of a class.

    The object is an entity that has state and behavior.

    Everything in Python is an object, and almost everything has attributes and methods.

Methods:
    Methods are functions defined inside the body of a class. They are used to define the behaviors of an object.

Inheritance:
    Inheritance is a way of creating a new class for using details of an existing class without modifying it.\

Polymorphism:
    Polymorphism contains two words "poly" and "morphs". Poly means many, and morph means shape.
    By polymorphism, we understand that one task can be performed in different ways.

    Polymorphism is an ability (in OOP) to use a common interface for multiple forms (data types).

    Example: Let a person behave as a father ,as a husband or a Employ at a time, this concept is call Polymorphism,

Data Abstraction:
    Data abstraction is the reduction of a particular body of data to a simplified representation of the whole.

    Abstraction is used to hide internal details and show only functionalities.

Encapsulation:
    Encapsulation is also an essential aspect of object-oriented programming. It is used to restrict access to
    methods and variables. In encapsulation, code and data are wrapped together within a single unit from being
    modified by accident.
